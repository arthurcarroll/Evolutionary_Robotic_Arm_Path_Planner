Evolutionary_Robotic_Arm_Path_Planner
=====================================

A path planner for a robotic arm which uses an evolutionary algorithm to determine paths around ojects. Supports up to 3 joints. This does not build without the correct version of JMonkey3 game engine and jbullet although it can still be used as engine-independent sample code.
